# Haskell WebAuthn Library

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/webauthn.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/webauthn)

This library implements the server-side
[Web Authentication Relying Party specification Level 2][spec]. The goal of Web
Authentication (WebAuthn) is to bring passwordless login/second factor
authentication to the web, logging in using a FIDO U2F Security Key, finger
print scanner and some other authenticator.

This project was originally developed in 2020 as a [Zurihac project](https://wire.engineering/haskell/events/2020/06/18/wire-goes-zurihac.html) by
[@arianvp](https://github.com/arianvp/) and [@duijf](https://github.com/duijf).
Starting September 2021 a team at [Tweag](https://www.tweag.io/) was sponsored
by [Mercury](https://mercury.com/) to create a production-ready open-source
implementation of this standard, which was done by
[@infinisil](https://github.com/infinisil/) and
[@ErinvanderVeen](https://github.com/ErinvanderVeen/).

## Setting up the environment
We assume Nix is used for the development of this library. If not using Nix,
take a look at `default.nix` for the dependencies and GHC version. All
instructions below assume the use of Nix.

### Nix Caches
Tweag provides a Cachix cache for the library itself and all
non-Haskell dependencies, setting up the `tweag-webauthn` cache can be
done using the [instructions][cachix] provided by Cachix.

### Nix Shell
The Nix shell provides all libraries and tools required to build the library,
tests, and example server. Simply call `nix-shell` to enter a shell. If the
binary caches have been configured properly, this should take little time. If
they have not been properly configured, entering the Nix shell will take
multiple hours.

All further instructions in this README assume that you are in a Nix shell.

## Getting Started
To get started with the library it is best to read the documentation of the
`Crypto.WebAuthn` module. An example of how to use this library to implement a
relying party can be found in the `server` directory, particularly the
`server/src/Main.hs` module. Additionally, we highly recommend reading the
[relying party section](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-security-considerations-rp)
of the
[WebAuthn security considerations chapter](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-security-considerations)
before implementing a relying party.

## Developing the Library
The [Haskell Language Server (hls)][hls] and [Ormolu][ormolu] are highly
recommended for the development of this library. The hls
[documentation][hls-editor] describes how to configure your editor to use it.
We also recommend enabling auto-format using Ormolu for your editor. We do,
however, also provide a bash script in `bin/autoformat.sh` that uses Ormolu to
format all Haskell source files in the repository.

Code not formatted using Ormolu will be rejected in CI.

## Running the tests
Tests are provided in the `tests` directory. Running these tests is done via
cabal:
```bash
cabal run test-suite:tests
```

## Running the demo
The library comes with an example implementation for a server that makes use of
it, which can be found in the `server` directory. All dependencies required to
build the example server are included in the Nix shell.
```bash
cd server
./run.sh
```

Changes to the server's source files automatically trigger a rebuild of the
server.

## Testing with an Authenticator
The easiest way to test the server, or your own application, is to use the
Chrome WebAuthn development tool. Simply open the Chrome DevTools, click on the
three dots in the top right, select "More tools -> WebAuthn", and then enable
the virtual environment.

Testing with a physical authenticator is easiest using an Android or iOS phone
supporting it, or a dedicated token like a [YubiKey][yubikey] or the
open-source [SoloKey][solokey]. Testing with a phone requires setting up a
certificate for the domain of the relying party as WebAuthn only works via
https, with an exception being made for `localhost`.

## Acknowledgements
The test files in `tests/responses/` were not created by Tweag, but
were instead copied from existing WebAuthn libraries. Notably the
[.NET][dotnet] and [python][python] libraries by the .NET foundation and Duo
Labs respectively.
